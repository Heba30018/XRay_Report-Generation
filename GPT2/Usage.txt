Certainly! Below are the instructions on how to run the provided Python scripts. You can include these instructions in the `README.md` file on GitHub.### Instructions to Run the Project#### PrerequisitesEnsure you have the following installed:- Python (version >= 3.6)- `pip` package manager- `transformers` library- `torch` library- `scikit-learn` library- `pandas` library- `Pillow` library- `nltk` library- `matplotlib` library- `tqdm` library#### Installation1. Clone the repository to your local machine:   ```bash   git clone <repository-url>   cd <repository-directory>   ```2. Install the required Python packages:   ```bash   pip install -r requirements.txt   ```#### Running the CodeThe project is split into different modules. Below are the instructions for running each part of the project:1. **Preprocessing the Dataset**:   This script prepares the dataset for training and saves the splits as CSV files.   ```bash   python preprocessing.py   ```2. **Building the Model**:   This script initializes the model with the specified encoder and decoder.   ```bash   python build_model.py   ```3. **Training the Model**:   This script trains the model using the preprocessed dataset and specified training arguments.   ```bash   python train.py   ```4. **Testing the Model**:   This script tests the trained model on the validation dataset and displays predicted captions along with the corresponding images.   ```bash   python test.py   ```5. **Calculating BLEU Score**:   This script calculates the BLEU score of the model on the validation dataset.   ```bash   python calculate_bleu.py   ```
